Awesome, you've got another tool in your belt now. Less allows you to open and view files without directly printing to the console.

I really hate to do this to you, but keeping this file open while running commands isn't ideal

so first type `q` to exit this program
and then use `head -n 41 .secret/setup.txt` to find out what to do next

head just shows us the start of the file, and -n allows us to specify that we want to see the first 41 lines(by default head shows 10 lines).  

tail is the counterpart to head and shows us the end of the file

Uh oh what happened?

Hint: Sometimes the file can be way too long for `cat <filename>` to work  as it simply prints everything to the terminal
Try `less <filename>` instead
