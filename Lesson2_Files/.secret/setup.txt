Welcome to Lesson 2

This lesson is going to be extremely simple. Infact that's the whole point. We're going to setup an entire CSE project on your desktop in no time at all. 

First we make a directory on our desktop with
	mkdir ~/Desktop/Example/CSE_Project

For the next two steps try
pressing the up arrow on your keyboard

you should now have the above command already filled in for you, isn't the terminal awesome?
	
	make a bin directory in the project
	make a src directory in the project

Now we've got to setup our text files, this is ususally the point where we'd break out gedit and start creating files. 
On the commandline we can create files by typing `touch <filename>`

Now for a new shortcut, don't we just love shortcuts?

We could type `touch ~/Desktop/Example/CSE_Project/src/source.cpp`
but remember? using the terminal is like being neo in the matrix, lets do it the cool way
`!$` uses the arguments from the last command we ran 

so we can use the following to do what we want much faster instead
	touch !$/source.cpp

--------- for most projects we would be done, but there a few other commands you might want to try

There are a few other useful commands we might want to run
mv - Move (useful for renaming files as well)
cp - Copy
rm - Remove (CAREFUL!!)
file - List file info

Say we wanted to move the directory from our desktop, to our documents folder.

We could run 
	mv ~/Desktop/Example/ ~/Documents/

Experiment with these commands and then use cd to move on to the next lesson
