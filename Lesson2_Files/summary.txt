In this lesson, you learned the following commands for manipulating
files:

        mv
        rm
        cp
        mkdir
        rmdir
        touch
        tar

There are a million ways to use these tools, and many of them are
incredibly powerful. For example, rm can be used to remove entire
directories, and cp can fling entire hard drives worth of content
around. 

While power is a good thing, too much power can be dangerous for
newer users. There is one command in particular that has a habit
of biting people when they least expect it...

BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL WHEN USING THE `rm` COMMAND!!

`rm` does not have a recycling bin. Once something has been hit by
`rm`, it is gone forever. In fact, if you run the following
command:

        ##DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND!!
        rm -rf /
        ##DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND!!

your computer will be wiped of everything that you have. If this
is your personal computer, this usually means all your documents
and the OS. If this is a server, it usually means all of
your data gets destroyed. Forever. Irreversibly.

The UNIX shell is powerful, but it is not particularly forgiving.
Be careful, think before you type, and check out strange commands
with tools like explainshell.com, and you'll probably be alright.*
