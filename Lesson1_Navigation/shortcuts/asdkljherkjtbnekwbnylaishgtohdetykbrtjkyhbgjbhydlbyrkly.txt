Hey, you made it! Note that while autocompletion is pretty awesome, it only
fills in as much as it can figure out. For instance, there are two files in here
named "pony1.txt" and "pony2.txt".

If you type "cat po" and hit TAB, the shell will complete to "cat pony".

Unfortunately, it stops there. The shell can't figure out whether you mean
pony1.txt or pony2.txt! If you hit TAB again, it'll show you a list of files that
it can't decide between. You can then clarify what you mean and it will complete
as far as it can. In this case, if you type a "1" and hit TAB again, it'll
autocomplete to "pony1.txt".

Feel free to play around a bit. When you're ready to go back, go up *two*
directories by using `cd ../..`.
