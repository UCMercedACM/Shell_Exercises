I don't know about you, but all this typing is really wearing on my fingertips.
Fortunately, there's an easier way to do all of this! Most shells come with
powerful history and autocompletion tools. Go ahead and press the up and down
arrow keys now. You should be able to see the commands you already issued
while working on this lesson.

Go ahead and cat this file again by running `cat objective.txt`. Don't
type the command out again though! Use the arrow keys to scroll through your
commands until you find one that matches, then hit ENTER to run it again.

Now that you have a handle on command history, let's look at TAB completion, one
of the most useful tools ever! Your next instructions are located in
`asdkljherkjtbnekwbnylaishgtohdetykbrtjkyhbgjbhydlbyrkly.txt`.

It would be ridiculous to ask you to type the whole file out...so we won't!
Instead, you should type "cat a" and then hit the TAB key. The shell
should be able to figure out exactly what you mean and fill out the file name
for you. Then hit ENTER.
