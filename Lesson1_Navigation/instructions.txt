Lesson 1 - Navigation

Objectives:
* To gain an understanding of the filesystem structure
* To understand how to move around the filesystem from the command line

Notations:
* For the rest of this tutorial, commands will be enclosed in backticks. For
  example, you got to this file by running `cat objective.txt`. Do not
  include the backticks when you are running the command.
* Larger pieces of code will be indented e.g. you opened this file by running

    cat instructions.txt

Procedure:
* Watch the presentation at the front to get an understanding of the filesystem
* Run `ls` to see all the files in in the directory
* Once you've done that run `cd flags` to cd into the directory flags
* Once inside, run `ls` and `cat` the the file you find

P.S. If you want to have some fun first, use `echo` to print things to the
screen. Try running `echo "hello world!"`, for example.
