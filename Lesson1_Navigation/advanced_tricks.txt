Well, you're just about ready to move on to the next lesson now. There are some
things I'd like to say before you do so though.

First off, the biggest mistake people make when first learning the shell is to
type everything back out. **Don't do that!** Use TAB-completion and command
history whenever you humanly can. If you log into a computer and find that it
doesn't support TAB-completes, switch to a shell that does! Use `bash`, `csh`,
`zsh`, `ksh`...whatever you can get your hands on that lets you use tab 
completion and command history.

Try to get through the rest of this tutorial using TAB
completion as much as possible.

Second, there are a whole bunch of nifty little expansions and shortcuts which
we didn't get to cover. For example, the tilde (`~`) will expand to your 
home directory, which is usually at `/home/<username>`. Try `echo ~` now to 
see the absolute path of your home directory on this server.

If you accidentally executed a bad `cd` command and want to go back, you can 
revisit your last directory with `cd -`. It functions as a convenient "go back"
and "undo" command in one.

When you're done, head up to the main directory (one above us) and then go to
Lesson 2.
