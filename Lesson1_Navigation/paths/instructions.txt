What is the path to this directory?

Not sure? Run	`pwd` to find out where you are!

There are two kinds of paths used in UNIX systems:
*		Absolute paths start from the root (/) and name every directory along the
		way. For instance, /home/user/spam/eggs.txt is an absolute path
*		Relative paths start at the current working directory (which you can find
		by using `pwd`), and continue downwards. They *DO NOT* start with a slash!

The next file you'll need to read is located further down in some directories.
Up until now, you've been cd-ing to the directory a file is located in and then
feeding `cat` the filename. This time, give `cat` a relative path: the file
is located at `a/folder/objective.txt`
