Great job! Notice that even though you passed a different path. your current
path hasn't changed: if you run `pwd`, you should find that it's the same
as before.

You can continue on to the next section if you want: the next directory will be
located at `../shortcuts` (is this a relative path or an absolute one, and why?)

However, there is a bonus question: you first accessed this file by using the
relative path `a/folder/objective.txt`. Can you figure out how to access it by
an absolute path? Hint: relative paths are relative to your current directory,
and `pwd` gives the path to your directory from the root. Could you combine
the two?
