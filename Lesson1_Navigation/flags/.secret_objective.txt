You found this file by running

		ls -a

The "-a" is what we call a flag: it modifies the behavior of the command we're
running. For the ls command, adding -a makes it display ALL files,
including hidden ones (hidden files have a dot at the beginning of their names).

You may have noticed two other files when you ran `ls -a`: their names are "."
and ".." These special files exist in every directory and refer to
"this directory" and "my parent directory" respectively. For example, the
following commands all do exactly the same thing:

		cat objective.txt
		cat ./objective.txt
		cat ../flags/objective.txt

Go ahead and cd back to the directory above this one by running

	cd ..

After that, continue to the next part of this lesson by running

	cd paths
