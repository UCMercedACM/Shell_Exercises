I recently updated my Fedora server with some spiffy new libraries.
Unfortunately, they were so spiffy that some of my programs stopped working.
I need to go back into my log files to see what happened.

Unfortunately, the computer decided to split my log files into two parts, so I
can't run grep on it! We'll need to reconstruct the original log file first.

Use `cat` and the output redirection operators `>` and `>>` to turn yum1.log
and yum2.log into a single logfile named "yum.log". Once you've done that,
look at step2.txt for what to do next.
