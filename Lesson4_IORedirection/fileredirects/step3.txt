Excellent! Unfortunately, that's not quite all we need. Updating
programs won't usually affect other programs--we need to find a list of
libraries. This is made pretty easy by the fact that libraries have the word
"lib" in their names.

Make a list of all updated libraries by using grep on your "updated.log" and
searching for "lib". Send the result to whatever file you'd like. When you're
done, run `./checkanswer.bash`
