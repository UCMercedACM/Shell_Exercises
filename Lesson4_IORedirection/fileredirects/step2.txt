Great! Now I have a single log file. I still need to find out which libraries
were changed though. Fortunately, yum is nice enough to tell us which lines
pertain to updates and which lines are installs. We need to find the updates,
which are labeled with "Updated".

Use grep to search for the phrase "Updated" in your newly-created yum.log.
Send the results to a file named "updated.log" Then look at step3.txt for the
next step.
