First, open up how2pipe.txt and read that. Once you've read it, come back here.

Now that you understand how pipes work, let's use them to solve the same
problem as last time, but with a lot fewer steps.

I have provided the complete yum.log for you. Write a single-line shell command
that finds updated libraries and prints the output to a file. HINT: Try looking
at the command at the end of how2pipe.txt

We can do all sorts of things with pipes now. For instance, we can write a
command that looks for all updates programs (that is, NOT a library) that has
the letter "c" in it's name. Try to write that one! HINT: use the -v flag of
grep to find all entries NOT matching a pattern.

Another handy trick is to pipe `ps` through `grep` to find a particular process.
Try running `ps -ef` to list all processes, then grepping for your username
in the output. You might be surprised at what you find.

Once you're done, go ahead and cd out of this lesson. This is the last lesson
in the series! At this point, you can ask one of the helpers about shell
scripting, or try some of the advanced exercises.
