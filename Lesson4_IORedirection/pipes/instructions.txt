The last exercise we did was an example in how powerful the shell is. In order
to get the final output file from most other methods, we would have had to
write a whole bunch of script with regexps---a nasty subject which is a full

There's one complaint though: if you run `ls ../fileredirects`, you'll notice
a lot of files littering the directory that are no longer of any use to us! We
created them just to pass them to the next program, and then they're useless
to us. In terms of our "stdout/stdin as pipes" analogy, it looks something like
