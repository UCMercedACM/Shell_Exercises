ACM Shell Tutorial
===================

Lessons 1-5 are in interactive shell usage through some small commands. If you have ideas for what should be added,
feel free to let me/whoever is working on it know.

I'm not sure how to do lessson 6 at the moment. Scripting is really cool, but generally considered an "advanced topic."

Please try to keep lesson modules under 5 minutes (though it may be difficult)
