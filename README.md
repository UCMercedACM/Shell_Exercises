ACM Shell Tutorial
===================

Lessons 1-5 are in interactive shell usage through some small commands. If
you have ideas for what should be added, feel free to let me/whoever is
working on it know.

I'm not sure how to do lessson 6 at the moment. Scripting is really cool,
but generally considered an "advanced topic."

Please try to keep lesson modules under 5 minutes (though it may be difficult)

Editing Rules
====================

Please make all instruction files markdown-compliant. If you need a reference,
use the [CommonMark tester](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus.html)

Remember that all files are intended to be opened in the terminal. Use standard
terminal file practices: keep line widths to 80 characters, and don't use
fancy UTF characters.

Please spell-check your files. In the spirit of the command line, both `spell`
and `aspell` are excellent CLI tools for this task.
