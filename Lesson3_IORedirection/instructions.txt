This lesson is mostly going to be reading and thinking. There will
only be three commands introduced in this lesson: the pipe (`|`), the
input redirect (`<`), and output redirection (`>` and `>>`). Don't think that
means it's not important! I/O redirection is arguably *the* thing that makes
the shell so powerful.

Go ahead and get started by opening up the file "stdwhat.txt" in this
directory. You might want to use `less`...it's a decent size. If you already
looked at the presentation on stdout and stdin and think you understand it,
you can go ahead and run `cd fileredirects`
